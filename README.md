# Factoring
Simple to use number factoring utility written in C++ for desktop and remote servers.
It's designed to be used from the command line because the interface is easy to implement on a multitude of platforms without
taking much space on the system disks and keeping as much of the system as possible available to factor the numbers and interact 
with other programs. Command line interfaces are also easy to implement over protocols like SSH without any extra effort on the 
user side while making it easy to port to any system easily.

Note that I created this program to solve one specific problem I had at the time, and I later upgraded it to list
prime factors and take commandline arguments in 2016. I only publish this in the hope that someone can use it.
